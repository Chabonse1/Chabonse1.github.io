    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        I am a graduate student at the University of Oklahoma pursuing a Masters in Management of Information Technology.
        I recently finished my bachelors in supply chain management. I have always been fascinated by the internal and external 
        nature of business. It is my passion to help companies grow in every major function of their value chain by providing tangible,
        sustainable solutions. I am innovative, competitive, and adaptive. I believe my experience and education both inside and 
        outside the classroom has equipped me with the skills that make me a competent and competitive candidate.
